By regulating its monetary policy and periodic revising of its interest rates, the Reserve Bank of India tries to achieve maximum employment, stable prices and an optimum level of growth. At one extreme, an economy that is growing fast can experience hyperinflation resulting from uncontrolled supply of money in the market which might have an adverse affect on the economy. A hike in the interest rate has a direct impact on the Indian economy and a higher reo rate might act as a barrier to the industrial development in the country. The increase might even lead to interest rate increase risk, lowering the value of an original investment.
