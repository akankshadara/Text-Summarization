By regulating its monetary policy and periodic revising of its interest rates, the Reserve Bank of India tries to achieve maximum employment, stable prices and an optimum level of growth. Contrary to the popular belief, excessive growth can in fact be detrimental. At one extreme, an economy that is growing fast can experience hyperinflation resulting from uncontrolled supply of money in the market which might have an adverse affect on the economy. At the other extreme, an economy with no inflation is essentially stagnated. The optimum level of growth and thus inflation is within these 2 extremes. It's the RBI's job to maintain that delicate balance. A tightening or rate increase attempts to head off future inflation while an easing or a rate decrease aims to spur economic growth. A hike in the interest rate has a direct impact on the Indian economy and a higher reo rate might act as a barrier to the industrial development in the country. As borrowing becomes costlier, this may result in fewer consumers taking loans for industrial investments and infrastructure development, which in turn, may cause a slowdown in the particular industry. The increase might even lead to interest rate increase risk, lowering the value of an original investment. On the other hand, if the interest rates fall, the businesses find it easier to finance expansion and other activities and henceforth, the economy benefits by an increased spending which leads to a faster growth in the industrial sector having a positive impact on the country's GDP. This step of RBI is crucial in preventing the chances of a market meltdown.
